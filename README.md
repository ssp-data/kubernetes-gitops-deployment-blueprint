# Data Platform Deployment Best Practices

This guide outlines best practices for deploying open data stacks on Kubernetes using GitOps principles, focusing on efficient patterns that work well with modern DevOps workflows while providing guidance for organizations transitioning from traditional deployment methods.

## Key Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between infrastructure, platform services, and applications
2. **GitOps-Driven**: Everything defined as code, with Git as the single source of truth
3. **Hierarchical Configuration**: Shared configurations at higher levels, specific overrides at lower levels
4. **Secret Management**: Secure handling of sensitive information using SOPS or sealed secrets
5. **Automation**: CI/CD pipelines for validation and deployment
6. **Observability**: Built-in monitoring and alerting for all components
7. **Multi-tenancy**: Isolation between different tenants/domains with clear access boundaries
8. **Release Management**: Consistent, repeatable deployment processes with clear versioning

## Recommended GitOps Stack

- **GitOps Controller**: Flux for continuous delivery on Azure/AWS
- **Package Management**: Helm Charts for application deployment
- **Secret Management**: SOPS with GitOps integration
- **Database Migration**: Liquibase for database schema changes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or similar for validation and deployment
- **Infrastructure Management**: Platform-specific tools (Azure ARM, AWS CloudFormation) for resources that must be created before Kubernetes
- **Data Integration**: dlt for reliable data loading
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Kestra for pipeline orchestration

## Deployment Workflow

1. **Cluster Provisioning**: Set up a Kubernetes cluster on Azure/AWS (can be done manually or automated)
2. **GitOps Bootstrap**: Install and configure Flux on the cluster
3. **Platform Deployment**: Deploy infrastructure components followed by platform services
4. **Tenant Provisioning**: Create tenant isolation boundaries
5. **Domain Configuration**: Apply business/data domain configurations within tenant boundaries
6. **Pipeline Deployment**: Deploy data pipelines within their domains

## Best Practices

### 1. Cluster Management

- Use managed Kubernetes services (AKS on Azure, EKS on AWS)
- Configure node pools for different workload types
- Implement proper network policies
- Use private clusters where possible
- Regularly update Kubernetes versions

### 2. Application Packaging

- Package applications as Helm charts
- Maintain charts in a dedicated Helm repository
- Version charts semantically (e.g., SemVer)
- Use Helm dependencies for component relationships
- Avoid mixing Helm and raw Kubernetes manifests when possible

### 3. Configuration Management

- Follow the "base/overlay" pattern with Kustomize
- Use Flux's Kustomizations to manage deployment ordering
- Define HelmReleases for application deployment
- Implement hierarchical configuration (cluster → environment → domain)
- Keep environment-specific values in overlay directories

### 4. Secret Management

- Encrypt secrets using SOPS with age or PGP keys
- Store encrypted secrets in Git
- Configure Flux to decrypt secrets automatically
- Organize secrets hierarchically by environment and domain
- Use external secret stores (Azure KeyVault, AWS Secrets Manager) for production

### 5. Multi-tenancy

- Implement namespace isolation between tenants
- Use Kubernetes RBAC to control access rights
- Apply network policies to restrict cross-tenant communication
- Implement resource quotas for fair resource sharing
- Consider tenant-specific persistent volumes for data isolation

### 6. Database Migration

- Use Liquibase for database schema management
- Store migration scripts in version control
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for database validation
- Run migrations as Kubernetes Jobs before application deployment
- Track migration history in a dedicated schema

### 7. Release Management

- Implement semantic versioning for all components
- Use tags to mark stable releases
- Deploy from specific Git SHA or tag, not from branch
- Implement GitOps-based promotion between environments
- Consider blue/green or canary deployment strategies
- Separate the release process from deployment process

### 8. CI/CD Pipeline

#### Continuous Integration

- Validate Kubernetes manifests
- Lint YAML files
- Test Helm chart rendering
- Validate Kustomize overlays
- Run static analysis on Dockerfiles
- Validate database migrations

#### Continuous Delivery

- Build and push Docker images to registry
- Update Helm chart values with new image versions
- Create Git tag for the release
- Generate release notes
- Deploy to development environment
- Run automated integration tests
- Promote to higher environments

### 9. GitOps Deployment with Flux

- Use Flux for automated deployments
- Define dependencies between Kustomizations
- Implement proper source reconciliation
- Use GitOps for promoting between environments
- Implement notification controllers for alerts
- Use image automation for automatic updates
- Leverage Flux's support for Helm, Kustomize, and raw manifests

### 10. Monitoring and Alerting

- Deploy observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
- Define SLOs/SLIs for critical services
- Implement alerts for SLO violations
- Create dashboards for key metrics
- Track costs and resource utilization

## Data Pipeline Development

Adding a new data pipeline typically involves:

1. **Create dlt Integration Script**: Develop a Python script using dlt to extract and load data
2. **Define Destination Schema**: Configure how data should be mapped to the destination
3. **Create Kestra Workflow**: Define a workflow to orchestrate the data pipeline execution
4. **Configure Secrets**: Set up secure access to source and destination systems
5. **Deploy and Monitor**: Deploy the pipeline and monitor its execution


## Azure-Specific Best Practices

When deploying on Azure, consider these additional best practices:

1. **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**:
   - Use ACR for storing Docker images
   - Integrate ACR with AKS for streamlined image pulling
   - Implement image scanning for security

2. **Azure Key Vault**:
   - Store sensitive credentials in Azure Key Vault
   - Use the CSI Secret Store Driver to mount secrets
   - Rotate credentials regularly

3. **Azure Monitor**:
   - Configure Log Analytics for centralized logging
   - Set up Application Insights for application monitoring
   - Create custom dashboards for visibility

4. **Azure Networking**:
   - Use Private Link for secure service connections
   - Implement proper network security groups
   - Consider Azure Firewall for enhanced security

5. **Azure Identity**:
   - Use Azure AD for authentication
   - Implement proper RBAC for all resources
   - Use Managed Identities for service authentication

## Migrating from Traditional to GitOps

For organizations transitioning from traditional deployment methods to GitOps:

1. **Start with Infrastructure as Code**: Define all infrastructure in code
2. **Containerize Applications**: Move applications to containers
3. **Implement CI/CD**: Set up automated build and test pipelines
4. **Adopt Kubernetes**: Deploy containerized applications to Kubernetes
5. **Implement GitOps**: Use Flux to manage deployments

## Simplified GitOps for Smaller Teams

For smaller teams or simpler projects, consider this streamlined approach:

1. **Flatten Directory Structure**: Reduce nesting levels
2. **Simplify Multi-tenancy**: Use namespaces without a tenant operator
3. **Consolidate Applications**: Package related services together
4. **Use Managed Services**: Leverage cloud provider managed services where possible
5. **Start with Core Components**: Begin with essential services and expand gradually

## Security Considerations

1. **Cluster Security**:
   - Enable private API server endpoints
   - Use network policies to restrict pod communication
   - Implement pod security policies/standards

2. **Application Security**:
   - Scan container images for vulnerabilities
   - Use non-root users in containers
   - Implement least privilege principles

3. **Data Security**:
   - Encrypt data at rest and in transit
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Manage secrets securely

4. **Compliance**:
   - Document all security controls
   - Implement audit logging
   - Regularly validate compliance requirements
